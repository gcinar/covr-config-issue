covr package fails to compute code coverage when config package is used in the tested package.

Testing:
Tests in this repo will pass (using testthat package).

Issues:

1- Failure when a test refers to a function using config
  Please run covr::package_coverage()

2- Failure when a test uses config (tested function does not use test)
  Please run covr::package_coverage()
  
3- Cases 1 & 2 together
  Please run covr::package_coverage()
